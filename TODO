DONE

* The slider's are not in a good position, and break the entire page if uncommented.
* put the slider in a drop down
* why is the spacial array debug white? shouldn't it be blue? <- (clamp was backwards)
* rendering of boids is broken, they are at the wrong angle
* dt is being multiplied by 60 in the js_go_main, need to change all the math to fix that
* the separation factor isn't working i think. not strong enough.
* replace "random draw forces" in boid simulation.
* use random generator for the random draw forces.
* in Update boids position and velocities. factor out random numbers
* upgrade the meta programming to accept different types.
* move all the html and web stuff into a different folder, (but some files need to be in the base folder for the github pages thing to work...)
* add a Boid number parameter (int), to the web side can change it.
* add toggles to the parameters as well.
* check for invalid property tags.
* setup_sliders.ts: // TODO use step. might clean this up a bit.
* make the toggles look good.
* boids bounce off walls
* boids hit obstacles, put a big rect in the middle of the screen.

NEXT

* boids dodge obstacles, put a big rect in the middle of the screen.

* have typescript control the walls, make more walls.

* make boids see in front of them. (with rays?)

* make the sim feel gooder.

* fix boid vortex of death (when a bunch of boids get stuck in the corner)

* boids follow mouse on mouse down

* boid.go: // TODO calculate position at moment of collision

* make the rendering a camera like, so you can scroll and what not.

* make the html canvas always be in the background of the page? so the image follows even if you scroll down, can use this for camera movement later.

* draw an actual image instead of the triangles? <- would require major typescript rendering, i don't think wasm has got that speed.

* have the go_boid_stuff/image use actual canvas stuff, for speed. would require a lot of refactoring on the typescript side.

* Make into my personal website, aka put my name and links to my stuff on it. boids path around name.
