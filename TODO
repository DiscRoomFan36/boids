NEXT

* rendering of boids is broken, they are at the wrong angle
* why is the spacial array debug white? shouldn't it be blue?

* dt is being multiplied by 60 in the js_go_main, need to change all the math to fix that

* add a Boid number parameter, to the web side can change it.

* The slider's are not in a good position, and break the entire page if uncommented.
* for the slides that have a small range (like cohesion factor) make the value the square of the number.
* move all the html and web stuff into a different folder, (but some files need to be in the base folder for the github pages thing to work...)


AFTER THE CODE IS IN A GOOD PLACE

* boids follow mouse on mouse down

* boids dodge obstacles, put a big rect in the middle of the screen.

* make the rendering a camera like, so you can scroll and what not.

* make the html canvas always be in the background of the page? so the image follows even if you scroll down, can use this for camera movement later.

* draw an actual image instead of the triangles? <- would require major typescript rendering, i don't think wasm has got that speed.

* have the go_boid_stuff/image use actual canvas stuff, for speed. would require a lot of refactoring on the typescript side.

* Make into my personal website, aka put my name and links to my stuff on it. boids path around name.
