LATER

* rendering of boids is broken, they are at the wrong angle
* why is the spacial array debug white? shouldn't it be blue?

* dt is being multiplied by 60 in the js_go_main, need to change all the math to fix that

* add a Boid number parameter, to the web side can change it.

* The slider's are not in a good position, and break the entire page if uncommented.
* for the slides that have a small range (like cohesion factor) make the value the square of the number.
* move all the html and web stuff into a different folder, (but some files need to be in the base folder for the github pages thing to work...)
