NOW

* The slider's are out of order and change on every run

LATER

* rendering of boids is broken, they are at the wrong angle


* The slider's are not in a good position, and break the entire page if uncommented.

* dt is being multiplied by 60 in the js_go_main, need to change all the math to fix that

* move all the html and web stuff into a different folder, (but some files need to be in the base folder for the github pages thing to work...)

* why is the spacial array debug white? shouldn't it be blue?

* add a Boid number parameter, to the web side can change it.
